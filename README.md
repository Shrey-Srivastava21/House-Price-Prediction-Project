# Project based on Predictive Analytics Model to predict the House Price💢

## 🎪Abouts📢 

The repository is a learning exercise to🎃:
1. Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
2. Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
3. Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process
4. Identifying the problem and Data Sources
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Pre-Processing the Data
7. Build model to predict the price of the House
